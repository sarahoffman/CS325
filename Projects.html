                <p id="wfw-summary">
                    <em>Waiting for Words</em> is a new song cycle with music and orchestrations
                    by Josua Lutian and lyrics and direction by Katie Monteleone.
                    The song cycle features eleven original songs that explore the ins
                    and outs of college experiences; the characters go through the process of
                    trying to figure out who they are, how they fit into the world, and how they
                    might find the words to express themselves. The song cycle will feature twenty-three
                    talented Colby performers and musicians and will premiere in
                    Colby’s Lorimer Chapel on April 13, 2018.

                    <em>Lost With You</em> is a new musical that tells the story of a family of
                    four who never seem to be in sync with one another. Emulating her
                    mother as a successful owner of a local iced tea company,
                    Juliette sells lemonade in the hopes of one day getting out of the
                    small town and becoming somebody. Meanwhile, Juliette’s older
                    brother Jerome spends his days playing chess alone, never
                    having felt like he belonged anywhere. When a new boy named Nick moves
                    into town, everything changes. Jerome suddenly finds himself lost in the
                    possibility of having met someone who makes him feel something real for the first time.
                    A heartwarming story about family and acceptance, <em>Lost With You</em>
                    explores what it means to find happiness in a place you never thought you would.

                <img src="images/ls.png" id="ls-logo" class="logo">
                <p id="ls-summary">
                    <em>Lemonade Stand</em> premiered on April 15th, 2016, at Colby College as a workshop performance.
                    The song cycle tells the story of a dysfunctional family of goofy characters who
                    own a lemonade stand business. When a new family moves in down the street and
                    opens a competing iced tea business, chaos breaks out. Filled with fun music and
                    an eclectic cast of characters, <em>Lemonade Stand</em> explores the ideas of acceptance,
                    family, and belonging. The show was later reimagined and revised into the musical
                    <em>Lost With You</em>, which premiered at Colby in February, 2017.
