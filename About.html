        <p>
            Josua Lutian is a young composer and musician from the Philippines.
            Growing up in such a culturally diverse and musically driven country,
            Josua has always been a performer at heart.
            His love for singing stemmed from his exposure to church music and 90’s power ballads at tender young age.
            Her continued performing as he moved to Singapore in 2008.
            He was featured in a couple of United World College of South East Asia’s <i>OPUS</i> concerts as a soloist
            in 2009 ("Bohemian Rhapsody") and 2011 ("I Dreamed a Dream" from <em>Les Misérables</em>).
        </p>

            He discovered his passion for musical theater composition at Colby College in Waterville,
            Maine, under the mentorship of Professor Steven Nuss.
            Along with his peers, Katie Monteleone and Ben Brougham,
            he composed and arranged the music for, and starred in their original musical <em>Lost with You</em> (2017).
            This project was an extension of their first song cycle <em>Lemonade Stand: The Musical</em> (2016).
            <em>Lost with You: the Musical</em> was workshopped in New York City and
            produced by Colby college in their campus in Waterville, Maine in 2017.
            As part of the project, Josua and his contemporaries had the opportunity
            to work with Broadway and industry professionals like director Ken Urso
            (Pace University, Actors Studio), choreographer Andrew Cao (<em>Aladdin</em>, <em>Anything Goes</em>),
            and guest musical director Kimberly Grigsby (<em>Spring Awakening</em>,
            <em>Amélie</em>, <em>Spider-man: Turn off the Dark</em>).
            For his work in the musical he was granted the Emanno Comparetti Music Award from Colby’s music department.
            This past December the original company was asked to perform for Colby’s capital campaign launch,
            Dare Northward, and had the chance to showcase music from <em>Lost With You</em> in
            The Appel Room at Jazz at Lincoln Center.
            Right now, Josua is co-writing a song cycle with Katie Monteleone called <em>Waiting
            for Words</em>. The cycle focuses on critical, poignant, and
            sometimes awkward moments a student experiences while at university.
            The song cycle will be performed at Colby College on April 13, 2018 in Lorimer Chapel at 7:30 pm.

            She will graduate from Colby College in May, 2018 with a
            Bachelor of Arts in English/Creative Writing and Theater & Dance.
            During college, Katie originated the song cycle, <em>Lemonade Stand</em>,
            co-written with Josua Lutian and performed at Colby College in April, 2016.
            She went on to write the book and lyrics for the original musical <em>Lost With You</em>
            (music by Josua Lutian and Ben Brougham), which was workshopped at Ripley-Grier
            Studios in New York City in January, 2017. Lost With You was produced at Colby College in
            February, 2017, with an additional performance at Lincoln Center in December, 2017.
            Katie, Josua, and Ben continue to revise the musical for future productions.
            Along with writing, Katie has a passion for directing - in April, 2017, she directed the musical
            <em>Spring Awakening</em>, through Colby’s student theater group, Powder and Wig.

        <p>
            Current and upcoming projects include: <em>How To Start Over</em>,
            Katie’s original audience-immersive play that she will direct this spring
            (performances April 20-21, 2018 at Colby); <em>Stories From College</em>, a
            new song cycle about college experiences with lyrics by Katie and music by Josua
            (performance April 13, 2018 at Colby). Finally, Katie is currently developing a new web series,
            <em>Saying Hi</em>, which examines the inner workings of the office of Doctor James Benson,
            a man who claims to have created a drug that can turn an introvert into an extrovert. <em>Saying Hi</em>
            will air online in 2019, created in collaboration with filmmaker Aaron Kalischer-Coggins (Discovery Channel).

            Katie also enjoys fiction writing and her latest piece,
            “In the Palm of Her Hand,” will be published in the online magazine,
            Verity La, this spring, 2018. Katie looks forward to working on many
            more creative projects in the future and would love to hear from anyone with ideas or
            comments. Feel free to reach out!
